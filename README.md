# **Project Plan: Face Emoji Generator**

**Goal:** To convert a selfie or a portrait photo into a stylized emoji or cartoon.

**Technology Stack:**

  * **Core Logic:** Python
  * **Image Processing:** OpenCV
  * **AI Model:** CartoonGAN (Generative Adversarial Network)
  * **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow or PyTorch

-----

#### **Phase 1: Research and Setup**

**1. Choose a CartoonGAN Implementation:**
Based on the search, several implementations of CartoonGAN are available for both TensorFlow and PyTorch. Both frameworks have pre-trained models and well-documented repositories. A good starting point would be to choose one that has a clear inference script and pre-trained weights.

  * **TensorFlow:** The `mnicnc404/CartoonGan-tensorflow` GitHub repository appears to be a solid choice. It offers pre-trained models for various cartoon styles (e.g., Shinkai, Hayao) and provides a clear `inference_with_saved_model.py` script. The model is also available as a `SavedModel`, which is easy to load and use for inference.
  * **PyTorch:** The `Yijunmaverick/CartoonGAN-Test-Pytorch-Torch` repository is also a strong candidate, offering pre-trained models converted to `.pth` format for PyTorch.

**2. Set up the Development Environment:**

  * Install Python 3.6+
  * Install OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
  * Install the chosen deep learning framework:
      * For TensorFlow: `pip install tensorflow`
      * For PyTorch: `pip install torch torchvision`
  * Install other required libraries like `numpy` and `Pillow`.

#### **Phase 2: Core Functionality**

**1. Face Detection with OpenCV:**

  * Use OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade classifiers or a more modern deep learning-based face detector (like a pre-trained model from the `dnn` module) to accurately locate the face in the input image.
  * The `cv2.CascadeClassifier` class with `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` is a simple and effective method for this step.

**2. Pre-processing the Face Region:**

  * Once the face is detected, crop the region of interest (ROI).
  * Resize the cropped face image to the dimensions required by the chosen CartoonGAN model (e.g., 256x256 or 512x512).
  * Normalize the pixel values to the range expected by the GAN model (e.g., `[-1, 1]` or `[0, 1]`). This is a crucial step for the model to produce correct results.

**3. Cartoonization with GAN:**

  * Load the pre-trained CartoonGAN model.
  * Feed the pre-processed face image into the GAN's generator network.
  * The network will output a cartoonized version of the face.

**4. Post-processing and Integration:**

  * The output from the GAN will likely be a NumPy array. Convert it back to an image format.
  * De-normalize the pixel values if necessary.
  * Paste the newly generated cartoonized face back onto the original image. This can be done by replacing the original face ROI with the new cartoonized one. This step is optional but can be used to create a "face emoji" effect on the original selfie.
